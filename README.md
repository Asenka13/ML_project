# ML_project - LOAN prediction

 ### About project

1. Predicting whether to give a client or reject a loan; 
2. We base on previous data about our clients;
3. Select variable which will help us and give us better prediction; 
4. Compare accuracy among the algorithms.

3. Encode categorical data into numbers;
4. Save the pre processed data to a new csv file;
5. Split the file into training and test files.
